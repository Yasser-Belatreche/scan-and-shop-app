# About The Source Code

This is a project I worked on for about 2 - 4 weeks, but I didn't complete it.

It's an app built using React Native for the front end and node js for the backend, the idea is like an app that allows you to scan a product and show you similar products from the global online market places (Amazone, Aliexpress, Alibaba...) and of course you can buy it directly from the app, but when I came to the point where I need a live API from the market places, I found that they didn't provide one as they did, but you need to be an affiliate partner with them. And to be accepted as an affiliate, you need to have the app live and also you need to sell several products per month. And since my app was just for learning purposes, And I have no budget to put in marketing and stuff so sadly I stop the project.

# Run the App

If you want to test the app on your machine just clone the whole repo and follow the instruction in the README file in `client` and `server` folders

# Things I learn from It

> ## In Software Engineering

- React Native.

- Typescript.

- Storybook library

- Some Good practices to structure your project, and write clean TS/TSX code.

- TDD (In the source code i did it wrong, you will find that i was testing the implementation details and not the behaviours of the system, but yeah we learn from our mistakes).

> ## In General

- Never start to work on a project without having a clear idea if it's feasible or not.

- Always When building Software, follow [Agile Principle](https://agilemanifesto.org/). And NEVER try to complete the product as a hole and after that launch it, but use continuous shipping method.
